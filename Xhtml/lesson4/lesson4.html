When I saw Rollo Martins first I
made this note on him for my security police files: "In normal circumstances a
cheerful fool. Drinks too much and may cause a little trouble. <br />Whenever a woman
passes raises his eyes and makes some comment, but I get the impression that
really he'd rather not be bothered. Has never really grown up and perhaps that
accounts for the way he worshipped Lime." I wrote there that phrase "in normal
circumstances" because I met him first at Harry Lime's funeral. It was February,
and the grave-diggers had been forced to use electric drills to open the frozen
ground in Vienna's central cemetery. It was as if even nature were doing its best to
reject Lime, but we got him in at last and laid the earth back on him like bricks. He
was vaulted in, and <strong>Rollo Martins</strong> walked quickly away as though his long gangly
legs wanted to break into a run, and the tears of a boy ran down his thirty-fiveyear-
old cheeks. Rollo Martins believed in friendship, and that was why what
happened later was a worse shock to him than it would have been to you or me
(you because you would have put it down to an illusion and me because at once a
rational explanation—however wrongly—would have come to my mind). If only
he had come to tell me then, what a lot of trouble would have been saved.</p>
<hr />
	<p align="justify"> If you are to understand this strange rather sad story you must have an impression
at least of the background—the smashed dreary city of Vienna divided up in zones
among the four powers; the Russian, the British, the American, the French zones,
regions marked only by a notice board, and in the centre of the city, surrounded by
the Ring with its heavy public buildings and its prancing statuary, the Inner Stadt
under the control of all four powers. In this once fashionable Inner Stadt each
power in turn, for a month at a time, takes, as we call it, "the chair," and becomes
responsible for security; at night, if you were fool enough to waste your Austrian
schillings on a night club, you would be fairly certain to see the International Patrol
at work—four military police, one from each power, communicating with each
other if they communicated at all in the common language of their enemy. I never
knew Vienna between the wars, and I am too young to remember the old Vienna
with its Strauss music and its bogus easy charm; to me it is simply a city of
undignified ruins which turned that February into great glaciers of snow and ice.</p>

<p align="justify">The Danube was a grey flat muddy river a long way off across the second bezirk, the Russian zone where the Prater lay smashed and desolate and full of weeds, only the Great Wheel revolving slowly over the foundations of merry-go-rounds like abandoned millstones, the rusting iron of smashed tanks which nobody had cleared away, the frost-nipped weeds where the snow was thin. I haven't enough imagination to picture it as it had once been, any more than I can picture Sacher's Hotel as other than a transit hotel for English officers or see the Kartnerstrasse as a fashionable shopping street instead of a street which only exists, most of it, at eye level, repaired up to the first storey. A Russian soldier in a fur cap goes by with a rifle over his shoulder, and men in overcoats sip ersatz coffee in the windows of Old Vienna. This was roughly the Vienna to which Rollo Martins came on February 7 last year. I have reconstructed the affair as best I can from my own files and from what Martins told me. It is as accurate as I can make it—I haven't invented a line of dialogue though I can't vouch for Martins' memory; an ugly story if you leave out the girl: grim and sad and unrelieved if it were not for that absurd episode of the British Cultural Relations Society lecturer.</p>

<p align="justify">A BRITISH subject can still travel if he is content to take with him only five English pounds which he is forbidden to spend abroad, but if Rollo Martins had not received an invitation from Lime he would not have been allowed to enter Austria which counts still as occupied territory. Lime had suggested that Martins might "write up" the business of looking after the international refugees, and although it wasn't Martins' usual line, he had consented. It would give him a holiday and he badly needed a holiday after the incident in Dublin and the other incident in Amsterdam; he always tried to dismiss women as "incidents," things that simply happened to him without any will of his own, acts of God in the eyes of insurance agents. He had a haggard look when he arrived in Vienna and a habit of looking over his shoulder that for a time made me suspicious of him until I realised that he went in fear that one of say six people might turn up unexpectedly. He told me vaguely that he had been mixing his drinks—that was another way of putting it.
Rollo Martins' usual line was the writing of cheap, paper covered Westerns under the name of Buck Dexter. His public was large but unremunerative. He couldn't have afforded Vienna if Lime had not offered to pay his expenses when he got there out of some vaguely described propaganda fund. He could also, he said, keep him supplied with paper Bafs—the only currency in use from a penny upwards in British hotels and clubs. So it was with exactly five unusable pound notes that Martins arrived in Vienna.

<p align="justify">An odd incident had occurred at Frankfurt where the plane from London grounded for an hour. Martins was eating a hamburger in the American canteen (a kindly air line supplied the passengers with a voucher for 65 cents of food) when a man he could recognise from twenty feet away as a journalist approached his table.
"You Mr. Dexter?" he asked.
"Yes," Martins said, taken off his guard.
"You look younger than your photographs," the man said. "Like to make a statement? I represent the local forces paper here. We'd like to know what you think of Frankfurt."
"I only touched down ten minutes ago."
"Fair enough," the man said. "What about views on the American novel?"
"I don't read them," Martins said.
"The well known acid humour," the journalist said. He pointed at a small grey-haired man with two protruding teeth, nibbling a bit of bread. "Happen to know if that's Carey?"
"No. What Carey?"
"J. G. Carey of course."
"I've never heard of him."
"You novelists live out of the world. He's my real assignment," and Martins watched him make across the room for the great Carey, who greeted him with a false headline smile, laying down his crust. Dexter wasn't the man's assignment, but Martins couldn't help feeling a certain pride—nobody had ever before referred to him as a novelist; and that sense of pride and importance carried him over the disappointment when Lime was not there to meet him at the airport. We never get accustomed to being less important to other people than they are to us—Martins felt the little jab of dispensability standing by the bus door, watching the snow come sifting down, so thinly and softly that the great drifts among the ruined buildings had an air of permanence, as though they were not the result of this meagre fall, but lay, forever, above the line of perpetual snow.
