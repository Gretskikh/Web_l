When I saw Rollo Martins first I
made this note on him for my security police files: "In normal circumstances a
cheerful fool. Drinks too much and may cause a little trouble. <br />Whenever a woman
passes raises his eyes and makes some comment, but I get the impression that
really he'd rather not be bothered. Has never really grown up and perhaps that
accounts for the way he worshipped Lime." I wrote there that phrase "in normal
circumstances" because I met him first at Harry Lime's funeral. It was February,
and the grave-diggers had been forced to use electric drills to open the frozen
ground in Vienna's central cemetery. It was as if even nature were doing its best to
reject Lime, but we got him in at last and laid the earth back on him like bricks. He
was vaulted in, and <strong>Rollo Martins</strong> walked quickly away as though his long gangly
legs wanted to break into a run, and the tears of a boy ran down his thirty-fiveyear-
old cheeks. Rollo Martins believed in friendship, and that was why what
happened later was a worse shock to him than it would have been to you or me
(you because you would have put it down to an illusion and me because at once a
rational explanation—however wrongly—would have come to my mind). If only
he had come to tell me then, what a lot of trouble would have been saved.</p>

	<p align="justify"> If you are to understand this strange rather sad story you must have an impression
at least of the background—the smashed dreary city of Vienna divided up in zones
among the four powers; the Russian, the British, the American, the French zones,
regions marked only by a notice board, and in the centre of the city, surrounded by
the Ring with its heavy public buildings and its prancing statuary, the Inner Stadt
under the control of all four powers. In this once fashionable Inner Stadt each
power in turn, for a month at a time, takes, as we call it, "the chair," and becomes
responsible for security; at night, if you were fool enough to waste your Austrian
schillings on a night club, you would be fairly certain to see the International Patrol
at work—four military police, one from each power, communicating with each
other if they communicated at all in the common language of their enemy. I never
knew Vienna between the wars, and I am too young to remember the old Vienna
with its Strauss music and its bogus easy charm; to me it is simply a city of
undignified ruins which turned that February into great glaciers of snow and ice.</p>
